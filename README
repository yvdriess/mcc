Measurement Calculus Compiler
------------------------------

1. Installation
---------------

Requires
 - Intel Thread Building Blocks 3.0
 - Intel Concurrent Collections 0.6
 - Steel Bank Common Lisp (sbcl) to bootstrap the compiler
 - Make sure all the TBB and CnC environment variables are set

Quick start
 'sh quickstart.sh' to bootstrap, compile and run a non-trivial program that should run in the order of single-digit seconds.

Bootstrapping
 'sh bootstrap.sh' runs a save-lisp-and-die on the MCC program written in Common Lisp, this creates a binary called ./mcc which accepts valid Measurement Calculus programs. 

Compiler
 './mcc < w3.mc' feeds a non-trivial (W3-entanglement creation) quantum computation to the compiler; producing C++ source and header files, respectively 'mccompiled.C' and 'mccompiled.h'

Running the mccompiled program
 run 'make' to build the generated C++ program and run the resulting './mccompiled'. There are two optional arguments. The first argument to mccmopiled is if you want to trace all collections (1) or not (0). As a second argument you can pass the number of threads CnC needs to limit itself to.
	./mccompiled [trace [num_threads]]
